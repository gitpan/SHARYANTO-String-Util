    SHARYANTO::String::Util - String utilities

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.28 of SHARYANTO::String::Util (from
    Perl distribution SHARYANTO-String-Util), released on 2014-07-25.

FUNCTIONS
  ltrim($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (including newlines) at the beginning of string.
    Equivalent to:

     $str =~ s/\A\s+//s;

  ltrim_lines($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (not including newlines) at the beginning of each line
    of string. Equivalent to:

     $str =~ s/^\s+//mg;

  rtrim($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (including newlines) at the end of string. Equivalent
    to:

     $str =~ s/[ \t]+\z//s;

  rtrim_lines($str) => STR
    Trim whitespaces (not including newlines) at the end of each line of
    string. Equivalent to:

     $str =~ s/[ \t]+$//mg;

  trim($str) => STR
    ltrim + rtrim.

  trim_lines($str) => STR
    ltrim_lines + rtrim_lines.

  trim_blank_lines($str) => STR
    Trim blank lines at the beginning and the end. Won't trim blank lines in
    the middle. Blank lines include lines with only whitespaces in them.

  ellipsis($str[, $maxlen, $ellipsis]) => STR
    Return $str unmodified if $str's length is less than $maxlen (default
    80). Otherwise cut $str to ($maxlen - length($ellipsis)) and append
    $ellipsis (default '...') at the end.

  indent($indent, $str, \%opts) => STR
    Indent every line in $str with $indent. Example:

     indent('  ', "one\ntwo\nthree") # "  one\n  two\n  three"

    %opts is optional. Known options:

    *   indent_blank_lines => BOOL (default 1)

        If set to false, does not indent blank lines (i.e., lines containing
        only zero or more whitespaces).

  linenum($str, \%opts) => STR
    Add line numbers. For example:

         1|line1
         2|line2
          |
         4|line4

    Known options:

    *   width => INT (default: 4)

    *   zeropad => BOOL (default: 0)

        If turned on, will output something like:

          0001|line1
          0002|line2
              |
          0004|line4

    *   skip_empty => BOOL (default: 1)

        If set to false, keep printing line number even if line is empty:

             1|line1
             2|line2
             3|
             4|line4

  pad($text, $width[, $which[, $padchar[, $truncate]]]) => STR
    Return $text padded with $padchar to $width columns. $which is either
    "r" or "right" for padding on the right (the default if not specified),
    "l" or "left" for padding on the right, or "c" or "center" or "centre"
    for left+right padding to center the text.

    $padchar is whitespace if not specified. It should be string having the
    width of 1 column.

  double_quote($str) => STR
    Quote or encode $str to the Perl double quote (""") literal
    representation of the string. Example:

     say double_quote("a");        # => "a"     (with the quotes)
     say double_quote("a\n");      # => "a\n"
     say double_quote('"');        # => "\""
     say double_quote('$foo');     # => "\$foo"

    This code is taken from "quote()" in Data::Dump. Maybe I didn't look
    more closely, but I couldn't a module that provides a function to do
    something like this. String::Escape, for example, provides "qqbackslash"
    but it does not escape "$".

  single_quote($str) => STR
    Like "double_quote" but will produce a Perl single quote literal
    representation instead of the double quote ones. In single quotes, only
    literal backslash "\" and single quote character "'" are escaped, the
    rest are displayed as-is, so the result might span multiple lines or
    contain other non-printable characters.

     say single_quote("Mom's");    # => 'Mom\'s' (with the quotes)
     say single_quote("a\\");      # => 'a\\"
     say single_quote('"');        # => '"'
     say single_quote("\$foo");    # => '$foo'

  common_prefix(@LIST) => STR
    Given a list of strings, return common prefix.

  common_suffix(@LIST) => STR
    Given a list of strings, return common suffix.
